This is our music mixer assignment :

TASK : Create a functional music mixer with drag and drop functionality to play music and mix with different samples.ðŸŽ§

Languages Used : Html,Css and js

Our inspiration is Sythwave:

Synthwave music, born from nostalgia for the 1980s, features pulsating basslines, lush synthesizers, and retro-futuristic vibes. Artists like Kavinsky and Carpenter Brut blend electronic, dance, and rock to create immersive soundscapes reminiscent of neon-lit cityscapes and vintage arcade games. It's a genre that transports listeners to an era of VHS tapes and analog synthesizers, blending nostalgia with innovation.
